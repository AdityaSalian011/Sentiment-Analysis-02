4,Prax,"putting this review up with a lot of responsibility. stay away from this hospital. the doctors and equipment might be top notch, but the money mindedness of the ownership and the customer service department is absolutely bordering on inhuman. i had the most terrible experience during my parent's hospitalization here, so much so that it is almost a trauma, and i have woved never to even look in the direction of Jupiter hospital. during a health crisis what one needs apart from healtcare is empathy, and this hospital looks at you just as one walking ATM, and the way they hound you if you are even a few hours late in payment is almost like vasooli.
