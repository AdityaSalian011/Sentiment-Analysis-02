8,Chintamani Chitale,"We have been regular visitors to Food Town for quite some years now. We visited today as well and ordered Mexican Sizzler.
There was a worm in the brocolli that came with the sizzler. It was pretty evident but the supposed chef Mr Vishal Thakur of course firstly denied it sighting that it is a blanched element in brocolli which it clearly wasn't...it was blanched well into the brocolli and was clearly a worm.
The ""Good Times"" award winner restaurant didn't even have the courtesy of saying sorry and showing the decency of even offering to not bill the wormed food item.
On the contrary Mr Thakur chose to hide behind the counter not even looking up as the serving waiter shamelessly just smiled.
As for us, this was the last time we visited this wretched minded restaurant.
Such big restaurants won't mind losing one loyal customer and would go on getting all pompous and high headed. I hope they learn their lesson soon the hard way.",negative,the customer found a worm in their brocolli at Food Town.,the customer felt disappointed by the restaurant's response to the issue.,

Recommendation

1) Triple Schezwan fried rice - the rice was long and it tasked good on it own but paired with the gravy it tasted delicious

2) Asparagus Tempura Shushi - Those who like sushi will definitely like this as well, sofr rice with crunchy Tempura tasted amazing although their wasabi was not original tasted more like garlic.

3) Lasooni Masala - This was one of the best Lasooni Masala I have tried, paired with Tandoor Butter roti it tasted absolute delicious

4) Panner Chilly Bao - One of the best Bao I have tried so far, soft Bao with delicious Paneer filling it was incredible.

Overall the food tasted really good, some of the dishes were not up to the mark like cheese cigar rolls, Mexican Pizza.

Must visit if you are vegetarian and looking for fusion food and multi cuisine dishes.
